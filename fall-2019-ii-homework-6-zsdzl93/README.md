## Homework 6 - Week 6

### Motivation
* Demonstrate your ability to program using exceptions, annotations and the ability to debug Java programs.

### Instructions
* There is one task to complete - stop the Evil Villain!
    - There's an evil villain on the loose.  He's been creating and planting bombs throughout the city.  Your task is to create a [BombSquadTechnician](src/main/java/edu/nyu/cs9053/homework6/BombSquadTechnician.java) implementation which can correctly diffuse all the villain's bombs as well as capture him.

* Note, for this homework to be correct you may only add your own classes and only change [ColorVisible](src/main/java/edu/nyu/cs9053/homework6/ColorVisible.java) and [BombSquadTechnicianRecruiter](src/main/java/edu/nyu/cs9053/homework6/BombSquadTechnicianRecruiter.java).  All other classes must not be modified at all.

### Implementation
* Ensure your code is correct by compiling and testing it.
* The only changes you'll need to make are to the classes `ColorVisible`, `BombSquadTechnicianRecruiter` and to create your own classes.
* A portion of your grade will be based upon readability and organization of your code.
    - Follow the naming guidelines of lecture
    - Break large functions into multiple functions based on logical organizations
