## Homework 2 - Week 2

### Motivation
* Demonstrate your ability to program procedurally in Java

### Instructions
* There are two tasks to complete.
    

  1) Supply implementations for the two `static` methods within [VehicleDataParser](src/main/java/edu/nyu/cs9053/homework2/VehicleDataParser.java)
  2) Provide the proper `javac` arguments to ensure all `.java` files compile and are placed within a directory named `target/classes` (creating the directories if they don't exist) within the file `compile.sh`
  
You must not use any Java Collection class; i.e. a class within package [java.util](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/package-summary.html), in your implementations.

You must not use the class [String](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html) in your implementations.  
  
### Testing
* Invoke the `test.sh` to test your solution
